\chapter{Methodology}
A. Explanation of the proposed experimental design
B. Description of the proposed applications to be used for the experiments
C. Overview of the proposed tools and techniques to be used to measure runtime performance
D. Proposed criteria for evaluating the results of the experiments

In order to answer this research question, the thesis will conduct a series of experiments to measure the runtime performance of applications that use reflected code and compare the results to applications that use generated static code. This will provide an empirical evaluation of the potential benefits of using C\# source generators to improve runtime performance. In addition, the thesis will also explore the limitations and drawbacks of using this approach and identify any best practices for using C\# source generators effectively.
